# Jiawei Liang

I'm currently a PhD student superivised by Professor Wei Zhang in Reconfigurable computing system laboratory ([RCSL](https://eeweiz.home.ece.ust.hk/)) at the Department of Electronic & Computer Engineering in HKUST. My research interests focus on hardware system and EDA for FPGA.
Previously, I obtained BEng and MSc Degree in school of EE from Beihang University, China, working for CNN pruning at that time. Later, I served as an IC designer for 2 years.
