### About Me

I'm currently a PhD student superivised by Professor Wei Zhang in Reconfigurable computing system laboratory (RCSL) at the Department of Electronic & Computer Engineering in HKUST. My research interests focus on hardware system, EDA, machine learning, and quantum computing.
Previously, I obtained my BEng and MSc Degree in EE from Beihang University, China. And I served as an IC designer for 2 years after that.
