### About Me

I'm currently a PhD student superivised by Professor Wei Zhang in Reconfigurable computing system laboratory ([RCSL](https://eeweiz.home.ece.ust.hk/index.html)) at the Department of Electronic & Computer Engineering in HKUST. My research interests focus on **hardware system, EDA, and machine learning**.
Previously, I obtained my BEng and MSc Degree in EE from Beihang University, China, working on CNN pruning. After that, I served as an IC designer for 2 years.

I love to explore delicious food. Welcome to recommend what you think delicious to me!
